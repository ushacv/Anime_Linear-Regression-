# Anime_Linear-Regression-
I have perform Linear Regression analysis on Anime Dataset through RStudio


# Anime is a Japanese Animation 

Objective :  is to frame a model that can give us a  regressed prediction of the Target- variable “rating”.
     such that we can predict which of the parameters are potential for anime production studios to develop
     strategies for improvement of ratings.
